Thank you for using GDrive Media Hub. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Information We Don't Collect

We want to be clear: **We do not collect, store, sell, or share your personal data.**

Our application is designed to be a client-side viewer for your Google Drive content. We do not have servers that store your files, browsing history, or personal information.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

The application requests access to your Google Drive solely for the purpose of:

* Displaying your media files (photos, videos, etc.) within the application interface.
* Allowing you to browse your Google Drive folders.

This interaction happens directly between your browser and Google's servers. We do not intercept, analyze, or store this data.

## 3. Google User Data

Our application accesses your Google user data (specifically, your Google Drive files) via the Google Drive API. This access is strictly limited to the functionality of the app (viewing media) and is performed on your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We use Google's services for authentication and data retrieval. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for information on how they handle your data.
